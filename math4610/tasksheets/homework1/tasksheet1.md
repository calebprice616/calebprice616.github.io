## Task 1
I set up a time to meet for office hours and met with Dr. Koebbe.

## Task 2
I emailed a link to Dr. Koebbe to my Git page, (https://calebprice616.github.io).

## Task 3
I have created a private repository labeled math4610 and have added Dr. Koebbe as a collaborator to the repository.

## Task 4
I have emailed Dr. Koebbe that I will be using the MacOS commandline environment for this course.

## Task 5
I have emailed Dr. Koebbe a link to the table of contents to my homework solutions, located at (https://calebprice616.github.io/math4610).

## Task 6
I learned that a version control system (like Github) allows a software team to manage changes made to the source code of whatever project their working on by sotring every modification in a database. There are many benefits to using a version control system when writing code, including being able to trace the changes made to the code and see when and where code stopped working and even using git blame to see who commited that piece of code. It also allows for different team members to branch off the source code and make their edits in that branch and depending on if their changes are successful or not, they can decide to push it to the master branch or not, even giving the opportunity for many people to work on different features of the code without breaking it for the others.
